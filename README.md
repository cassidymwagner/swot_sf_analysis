#### Working directory for my scripts and Jupyter notebooks for analyzing [simulated SWOT swaths from MITgcm ECCO](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SWOT_SIMULATED_L2_KARIN_SSH_ECCO_LLC4320_SCIENCE_V1?ids&values&search=swot%20simulated%20level-2&provider=POCLOUD).

These scripts preprocess the data, estimate geostrophic velocities from SSH data, and calculate structure functions using my in-development package, [Oceans SF](https://github.com/cassidymwagner/oceans_sf/)

`swot_analysis_scripts.ipynb` and `swot_analysis.py` are the only files here that have been used/updated recently (Fall 2023).
